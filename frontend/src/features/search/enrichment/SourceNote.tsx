/**
 * Tissue expression is GTEx-derived, not HPA. The tab credited the Human
 * Protein Atlas until 2026-08; the tissue vocabulary was always GTEx.
 *
 * The release is GTEx v6.0, processed with YARN (Paulson et al., BMC
 * Bioinformatics 2017) and inherited from HuRI. That is why there are 36 tissues
 * rather than GTEx's 54, and why brain appears as three clusters — YARN merged
 * the subregions by PCoA into basal ganglia / cerebellum / other. Traced from
 * the HuRI portal's About page, since neither codebase records it.
 *
 * The values are qsmooth-normalized, so the >= 5.0 threshold is NOT convertible
 * to TPM — do not describe it in TPM terms. Whether a log2 step followed qsmooth
 * is the one part still unconfirmed, which is why the note states the threshold
 * without interpreting it. See docs/DATA_PROVENANCE_QUESTIONS.md.
