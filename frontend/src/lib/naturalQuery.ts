 * Turn a typed phrase into a gene search plus filter settings.
 *
 * Deliberately not a language model. Every entity a biologist names in one of
 * these questions — a gene, a tissue, a dataset — is already a value in our own
 * database, so matching against those lists answers the realistic queries with
 * no dependency, no API call, no data leaving the deployment, and no capacity to
 * invent a filter nobody asked for. openPIP is software other labs install; a
 * model would become their problem too.
 *
 * The design rule that matters: this never silently reinterprets a search. What
 * it understood is returned in `applied` and shown to the user, and the filters
 * it sets are the same ones in the sidebar, so a wrong guess is visible and can
 * be switched off. What it did not understand is returned in `ignored` and said
 * out loud rather than dropped.
