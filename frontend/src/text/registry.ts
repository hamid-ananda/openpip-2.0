 * `proteins` are dense UI labelling that nobody asked to retitle; `api` derives
 * its one deployment-specific value, the base URL, from the Site URL setting;
 * `about`, `faq` and `contact` keep the single rich-text block their pages have
 * always had instead; `authLabels` is the sign-in furniture — "Password",
 * "Forgot?", "Send reset link" — which every site words the same way. They all
 * stay registered so their pages keep resolving through `t()` — dropping them
 * would make every key render as its own name — they simply always serve their
 * shipped defaults.
