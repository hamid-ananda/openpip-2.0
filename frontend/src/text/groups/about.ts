Briefly, ORFs from the hORFeome collection were transferred into DNA-binding (DB) and activation domain (AD) Y2H destination vectors (see below). The vectors were consequently used to transform yeast strains (see below). Strong DB autoactivators were removed prior to screening. Yeast strains with 1,000 different AD-ORFs were pooled and mated with a single DB-ORF yeast strain. Growing yeast colonies were picked and sequenced to identify likely interacting pairs (First Pass Pairs = FiPPs). FiPPs were consequently individually tested in quadruplicate in a Y2H pairwise test and sequence confirmed resulting in a dataset of verified PPIs. A random subset of these verified PPIs are selected and tested in orthogonal protein interaction detection assays along with sets of known PPIs (positive control) and random pairs of proteins (negative control) to test for the quality of the identified PPIs. If found to be of high biophysical quality, the dataset is considered as validated and as such meets our criteria for publication. Of note, validation controls for the biophysical quality of the identified interactions. Dissecting the functional relevance of a given PPI requires extensive experimental follow-up.',

The confidence score can be used to further prioritize interactions for experimental follow-up wherever needed. The score is based on information from the Y2H experiments and retest rates of specific subsets of PPIs in MAPPIT and GPCA. The score is the output of a statistical model of the MAPPIT and GPCA tests, which corrects for lower retest rates as a result of differences in the experimental detectability of PPIs rather than differences in their biophysical quality (see HuRI paper on detectability of PPIs).',

This second component is constrained by data from testing PPIs found in Y2H which have additional independent literature evidence. The confidence score is calculated as the first component, scaled to an estimate of the overall precision of the dataset, obtained using the procedure described in Venkatesan et al Nature Methods 2009. The six features of a PPI used are: the number of screens in which it was detected; the number of different versions of the Y2H assay in which it was detected; the strength of growth of the yeast; whether the interaction between proteins X and Y was detected with both combinations of DNA-binding domain (DB) and activation domain (AD) fusions, i.e. DB-X with AD-Y and DB-Y with AD-X; the number of interaction partners of the two proteins; and the length of the ORF.',
